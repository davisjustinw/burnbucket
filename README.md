# burnbucket

Budget, burn, track.  Burnbucket an abstract budgeting tool allows users to name budgets, set amounts, then spend against those budgets with annotated entries.  Track tasks and time on projects, hours spent in a week, calories in a day whatever can take a number.   Burnbucket is meant to be simple, flexible and unobtrusive. So bucket creatively, bucket what's precious.
