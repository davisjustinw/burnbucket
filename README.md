# burnbucket

Budget, burn, track.  Burnbucket an abstract budgeting tool allows users to name budgets, set amounts, then spend against those budgets with annotated entries.  Track tasks and time on projects, hours spent in a week, calories in a day whatever can take a number.   Burnbucket is meant to be simple, flexible and unobtrusive. So bucket creatively, bucket what's precious.

## Inspiration
- Time is precious
- What is the price of Time
- What is the price of many things
- Use rate to know how things are spent
- Treat yourself as a business
- What's your value.

## Brainstorm
- Allow automatic time stamps
- CLI centric?
